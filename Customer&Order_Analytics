In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


--How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
--or
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, location, Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(price*Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND feb.Quantity > 2;
